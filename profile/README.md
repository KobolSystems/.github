## Welcome to Kobol Systems!
<p align="justify">
At Kobol Systems, we don’t just think outside the box—we've misplaced the box entirely. We specialize in creating cutting-edge cybersecurity education tools and automotive diagnostic adapters. But that's not all! We're constantly tinkering, inventing, and occasionally setting off the smoke alarms with our myriad other projects, including large language models and AI.

Ever wondered what would happen if Skynet had a sense of humor? So did we! That's why we're diving into the world of AI, teaching machines to understand, respond, and maybe even crack a joke or two (don’t worry, our robots are more 'friendly assistant' than 'world dominator').

Whether you're here to bolster your cyber defenses, diagnose your car's hiccups, or just witness the marvels of our latest 'What-Does-This-Button-Do?' adventure, you've come to the right place. Join us on this wild ride of innovation, learning, and a dash of chaos. Let's build something awesome (and maybe a little quirky) together!
